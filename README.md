##Sphere Online Judge Solutions

This is the repository containing my Sphere Online Judge Competitive programming solutions.

The solutions are written in either Python, C or C++ although most are written in C++ because of the timed nature of Sphere Online Judge.

All solutions are MIT Licensed and available for use. Just try the problems on your own first though.

Makefile is GNU GPL licensed.

###Workflow

I use Vim + Sublime for editing and writing the source files and compile them with GNU Make. Debugging is done by valgrind for C like code. 

Most problems are Number Theory based since I'm only experienced in it as a high school student.

I don't use macros and stick with the standard library in case of C++. I do implement some hacks though, to make `cin` and `cout` faster.
